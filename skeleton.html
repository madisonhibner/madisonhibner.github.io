<h2> About Me </h2>
	<img src="images/about_me_picture.jpg" alt="Madison Hibner in red cowgirl boots" style= "float:left">
<p> <strong>Howdy!</strong> My name is Madison Hibner. I'm currently a junior at The University of Wisconsin-Madison studying strategic communications with certificates in digital media studies and entreprenuership...exciting things! Throughout the later years of my childhood I discovered my passion for creative content creation and creative expression. Ideally after graduation I would love to work within an advertising agency although, I'm still learning more about the specific role for me. </p>

	<p> My chilhood was rooted right outside of Madison, WI in the suburban town of Cottage Grove. I loved growing up in such a traditional neighborhood alongside both my parents and two younger brothers. I was able to live a beautiful, simple, and fun childhood without ever having to grow up too fast. Now, at the age of twenty I look forward to extending my reach beyond the Madison-area with the hopes of exploring more this country has to offer post-graduation. </p>

	<p> The intention of this website is to provide a quick, yet visual representation of my work thus far in my career. My fabulous education at UW-Madison has provided me numerous opporunities to develop my professional skills via classes. In result, I have accumulated a variety of work including photography, videography, written articles, and creative graphics. I hope you are able to appreciate the thought, skill development, and creative emphasis dedicated to my work as much as I do! </p>
